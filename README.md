Multimodal Emotion Recognition
Project Overview
This project aims to build a Multimodal Emotion Recognition system that combines visual and textual data to predict human emotions accurately. The model leverages facial expression data from the FER 2013 dataset alongside textual sentiment data from the Sentiment140 dataset to perform robust emotion classification.

Datasets Used
FER 2013 (Facial Expression Recognition 2013)
Source: Kaggle FER2013

Description: Contains grayscale images of faces labeled with seven different emotion classes: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral.

Usage: Provides visual modality for emotion recognition through facial expression analysis.

Sentiment140
Source: Sentiment140

Description: A large dataset of 1.6 million tweets labeled with sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral) based on emoticons.

Usage: Provides textual modality for emotion detection from social media text.

Features
Multimodal Input: Combines image-based facial emotion recognition and text-based sentiment analysis.

Preprocessing: Includes image normalization and text tokenization.

Model Architecture: Ensemble/Hybrid model integrating CNNs for images and LSTM/Transformer-based models for text.

Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score on benchmark datasets.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Libraries:

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

tensorflow / pytorch (specify which you use)

nltk / transformers (for text processing)

opencv-python (for image processing)

matplotlib / seaborn (optional, for visualization)


Dataset Preparation
FER 2013:

Download and extract the dataset from Kaggle.

Preprocess images and labels as per scripts/preprocess_fer2013.py (if applicable).

Sentiment140:

Download the CSV dataset.

Clean and tokenize tweets using scripts/preprocess_sentiment140.py.
